# TidalCyclesLoops
TidalCycles (https://tidalcycles.org/) is a live programming language for creating music. It operates by sending control signals to SuperCollider, which may play sound clips, use SuperCollider synthezisers, or generate Midi signals which is sent to other midi synths. I use the Helm synth (https://tytel.org/helm/). 

This repository will contain several "songs"/audio loops, and SuperCollider setup script(s).
